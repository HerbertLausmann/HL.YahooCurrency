# HL.YahooCurrency
## .NET C# Multiplatform wrapper for Yahoo Currency Web Service. Convert between over 100 different currencies.

With this API you can convert between over 100 different currencies.
This is just a nice wrapper around the Yahoo Currency web service. But I've added some interesting things like:

1. Conversion between one currency and another, given some value to convert!
2. XAML and Data binding support. You can declare an YahooCurrency object and bind to it directly in XAML without any code behind!
3. Asynchronous support. This library uses async and await. You can get a complete experience without any UI freezing.
4. This API comes with a data base that gives you some interesting information about each currency, like:
   -The currency's country name.
   -The currency country's flag icon.
   -The currency's unicode symbol.
   -The currency's universal code.
5. Multi platform support. Because this is a .NET CORE (2) library, you can use for XAMARIN, MONO, Win Forms, WPF and all platforms and frameworks support .NET CORE/STANDARD
